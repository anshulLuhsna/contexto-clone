SETUP:

1) Clone into a folder.
2) Run `npm install`
3) Run `npm run dev`

A few things to know:

1) Lowercase and uppercase letters are separate in the corpus. So dont capitalize the first letter while entering.
2) The words in the code are encrypted to avoid cheating or rather "accidental stumbling upon them while going though the code" lol.
3) The ranks of similar words are calculated on the basis of pre-trained vectors (gloVe_6B) from Stanford's NLP group. Here is the link to their amazing project: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
