SETUP:

1) Clone into a folder.
2) Run `npm install`
3) Run `npm run dev`

A few things to know:

1) Lowercase and uppercase letters are separate in the corpus. So dont capitalize the first letter while entering.
2) If you look around in the code or in words.json you will see answers easily, so... don't. It will be fixed soon.
3) Right now there are 2 working levels, atleast 8 more will be added soon.
4) Do remember this is contexto for MUMBO ;)
